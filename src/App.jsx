                <p>
                  Hello! I'm Dominik, a <Age date={"11/17/2003"} /> old <span>self-taught developer</span> from <Tooltip text={() => "ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª Deutschland"}>Germany</Tooltip> with a passion for <span>coding and technology</span>.
                  My journey in programming began at 14 when I started creating <span>Minecraft plugins</span>.
                  Through <span>learning by doing</span>, I've gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in various areas of <span>software development</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After finishing school, I pursued a formal education as an <span>application developer</span>, which has sharpened my skills even more.
                  At 17, I had my first encounter with <span>web development</span>, opening up a world of exciting possibilities.
                  Around the same time, I started exploring <span>Python</span> and have since developed several <span>Discord bots</span> and other fun projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                  At 18, I dove into the <span>Discord client modding</span> community and created a few plugins, expanding my understanding of <span>system interactions</span>.
                  I also have hands-on experience with <span>Linux servers</span>, <span>Docker</span>, and <span>reverse proxy setups</span>, which I find incredibly enjoyable to work with.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Currently, I'm relatively advanced in <span>JavaScript</span>, <span>Python</span> and <span>Docker</span>.
                  I also have basic knowledge of <span>SolidJS</span> and <span>React</span>, and I'm always eager to learn more.
                  My approach to development is driven by <span>curiosity</span> and the desire to create <span>efficient and effective solutions</span>.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I'm excited to continue growing my skills and taking on new, <span>challenging projects</span>.
                </p>
